## Key Insights from Data Analysis
1. Fan Challenges and Merchandise Purchases:

Users who complete more fan challenges tend to purchase more virtual merchandise. There is a clear positive correlation between challenge completion and purchases.

2. Sponsorship Interactions and Monetization:

Users who interact more with sponsorship ads (clicks, views) are more likely to purchase merchandise. While the correlation is moderate, it suggests that integrating sponsors into challenges could drive both merchandise sales and ad revenue.


3. Live 360 Engagement:

There is no strong direct correlation between time spent on Live 360 and merchandise purchases. However, users who spend more time on Live 360 tend to complete more challenges, which indirectly leads to higher merchandise sales.


4. Real-Time Chat Activity:

Users who are more active in the real-time chat during events do not necessarily purchase more merchandise, but they are highly engaged overall. This activity could be leveraged for engagement-focused campaigns rather than direct monetization.

## Fan Challenge Proposal: "Predict and Win with Live 360!"
Challenge Concept: Users engage in real-time predictions during race events via the Live 360 feature, predicting outcomes like the fastest lap or most overtakes. Correct predictions earn points, which can be redeemed for discounts or exclusive merchandise.

Incentives: Bonus points are awarded for interacting with sponsorship content (e.g., ad clicks), driving both engagement and sponsorship monetization.

#### Predicted Outcomes:


Increased Engagement: Users will spend more time on Live 360, boosting real-time chat activity and in-app participation.

Higher Merchandise Sales: Rewarding users for correct predictions with discounts and exclusive items will drive merchandise purchases.

Increased Sponsorship Interactions: By integrating sponsorships into the challenge with points incentives, users will be more inclined to engage with ad content.
